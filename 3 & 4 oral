---------------perceptron Learning Rule----------
Perceptron Learning Rule states that the algorithm would automatically learn the optimal weight coefficients. 
Single layer Perceptrons can learn only linearly separable patterns
-----------decision region-----------
 a specific region within the input space which corresponds to a unique output class.
 ----------blob----------
 BLOB is generally a collection of large complex data in the Database. 
 The make_blobs() function sometimes can be used to generate blobs of points with a Gaussian distribution.
