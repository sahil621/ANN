---McCulloch-Pitts Model of Neuron------
It was the earliest ANN model, has only two types of inputs â€” Excitatory and Inhibitory.
The excitatory inputs have weights of positive magnitude and the inhibitory weights have weights of negative magnitude.
The inputs of the McCulloch-Pitts neuron could be either 0 or 1. 
It has a threshold function as an activation function.
---------Mp neuron-------
The MP neuron takes binary input and gives binary output. 
If the input data is not binary it can be compacted to binary before it can be feeded to the model.
The classification is also binary which is 0 or 1.
