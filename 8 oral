----Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART)----
The ART networks are known to solve the stability-plasticity dilemma i.e., 
stability refers to their nature of memorizing the learning and plasticity refers to the fact that they are flexible to gain new information.

---------Types of Adaptive Resonance Theory(ART) ---------
ART1 – It is the simplest and the basic ART architecture. It is capable of clustering binary input values.
ART2 – It is extension of ART1 that is capable of clustering continuous-valued input data.
Fuzzy ART – It is the augmentation of fuzzy logic and ART.
ARTMAP – It is a supervised form of ART learning where one ART learns based on the previous ART module. It is also known as predictive ART.
FARTMAP – This is a supervised ART architecture with Fuzzy logic include

------Advantage of Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART)------
It exhibits stability and is not disturbed by a wide variety of inputs provided to its network.
It can be integrated and used with various other techniques to give more good results.
It can be used for various fields such as mobile robot control, face recognition, land cover classification, target recognition, medical diagnosis, signature verification, clustering web users, etc.
It does not guarantee stability in forming clusters.

Limitations of Adaptive Resonance Theory Some ART networks are inconsistent (like the Fuzzy ART and ART1) as they depend upon the order of training data,or upon the learning rate.
