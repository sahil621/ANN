----------Back Propagation Network------
Backpropagation is an algorithm that backpropagates the errors from the output nodes to the input nodes. 
Therefore, it is simply referred to as the backward propagation of errors. 
It uses in the vast applications of neural networks in data mining like Character recognition, Signature verification, etc.

---------Xor--------

The XOR function is a binary function that takes two binary inputs and returns a binary output. 
The output is true if the number of true inputs is odd, and false otherwise.
In other words, it returns true if exactly one of the inputs is true, and false otherwise.

---------sigmoid-----
The sigmoid is a mathematical function that maps input values to a value between 0 and 1, making it useful for binary classification and logistic regression problems.

--------Forward propogation----------
Forward propagation is the way data moves from left (input layer) to right (output layer) in the neural network.
A neural network can be understood by a collection of connected input/output nodes. 
The accuracy of a node is expressed as a loss function or error rate.
