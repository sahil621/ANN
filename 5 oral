---------------Bidirectional Associative Memory (BAM)------
it is a supervised learning model in Artificial Neural Network.
This is hetero-associative memory, for an input pattern, it returns another pattern which is potentially of a different size.
similar to the human brain.
The main objective to introduce such a network model is to store hetero-associative pattern pairs.
It uses a chain of mental associations to recover a lost memory like associations of faces with names,
in exam questions with answers, etc. In such memory associations for one type of object with another
------------Limitations of BAM-----
Storage capacity of the BAM: In the BAM, stored number of associations should not be exceeded the number of neurons in the smaller layer.
Incorrect convergence: Always the closest association may not be produced by BAM.
