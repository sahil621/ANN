-------------Perceptron------
Perceptron is one of the simplest Artificial neural network architectures.
--------Types of Perceptron--------
single-Layer Perceptron: This type of perceptron is limited to learning linearly separable patterns. 
effective for tasks where the data can be divided into distinct categories through a straight line.
Multilayer Perceptron: Multilayer perceptrons possess enhanced processing capabilities as they consist of two or more layers,
adept at handling more complex patterns and relationships within the data.
--------Activation Function-------
An Activation Function decides whether a neuron should be activated or not.
This means that it will decide whether the neuron's input to the network is important or not in the process of prediction using simpler mathematical operations.
-------------ascii------------
ASCII, a standard data-encoding format for electronic communication between computers. 
ASCII assigns standard numeric values to letters, numerals, punctuation marks, and other characters used in computers.
